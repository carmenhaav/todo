To DO list
===
Primitive to do list application assignment for the company 
(sorry, cannot name it) I applied for. This project uses 
[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) framework for
faster development.

Overview
------
#### Client/user side
Client/user side starts with entering button that leads to main page.
From there user can add a task/item by pressing 'add' button. Updating
the task is simple - just by clicking on the task it becomes
active. Also, user can delete the tasks by clicking the checkbox
and pressing the remove button. For that, all the tasks are bind with
unique id. User can see the list of all the tasks/items. Newest added
task is the last of the queue.
